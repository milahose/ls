# Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby.
# And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

# what is != and where should you use it?
# => to check inequality

# put ! before something, like !user_name
# => determine if user_name has a truthy value

# put ! after something, like words.uniq!
# => mutate the caller (depending on method)

# put ? before something
# => (depends on method)

# put ? after something
# => ternary operator (if/else)

# put !! before something, like !!user_name
# => check if it is NOT falsy (aka, truthy)
